Although born in a prosperous realm, we did not believe that its boundaries should limit our knowledge, and that the lore of the East should alone enlighten us.;Charles de Secondat
Science and vision are not opposites or even at odds. They need each other.

I'd like to point out that even science is a science, and still very few people can do it, let alone do it well.;Eric Ries
A movie like House of the Dead with around $7 million budget or Alone in the Dark with around $16 million budget are much easier to make profit than the typical $50 million major motion picture.;Uwe Boll
If you're truly in a band and you guys have been together for a long time, there's a family bond that you have.

In my cranky old age, I actually prefer recording alone now, on 'The Simpsons,' for example, because I find that the director can just focus on what I'm doing and I can do a lot of variations. A lot of times, when I record with a group, I'll stay after class for another hour or two.;Hank Azaria
I'm so secluded. Very alone.;Yves Saint Laurent
It felt like the first thing, but when I first started out, I got a job adapting a book by Russell Banks called 'Rule Of The Bone.' I didn't do a very good job. I didn't really know what I was doing in general, let alone how to adapt a book.;Paul Thomas Anderson

I am convinced that living in an enclave shapes the personality, and living alone shapes the personality too.;Mary Douglas
European investment in Texas alone exceeds all U.S. investment in China and Japan put together.;John Bruton
There's great sadness and life doesn't work out like you would want, on a lot of levels, but there's no need to feel all alone. This happens to everybody, so there's no cls-pity. This is the ride that humans are on, and all of it is essential for our natural part of it.;Mike Mills

But there's not enough time in life to go sit at a party, have a drink, and make idle conversation. There's too many important things to do. Just being together with my husband, spending time alone, which I have very little of.;Pia Zadora
Tell me who is able to keep his bed chaste, or which goddess is able to live with one god alone?;Sextus Propertius

Mr. Churchill is proud of Britain's stand alone, after France had fallen and before America entered the War.;Eamon de Valera

The White House alone cannot hold its opponents accountable.;Paul Weyrich
Largely this is a class thing - writers tend to be cosseted little middle-class kiddies who think that the world owes them a royalty cheque.

The writing is really hard. You're alone. It really pulls it out of you. You pull it out of your head.

You sit in a chair and it will all come rushing at you like a wind tunnel.;Tony Gilroy

I've always been shocked and waiting-for-the-other-shoe-to-drop that a girl would ever talk to me, let alone want to marry me.

Urs Fischer specializes in making jaws drop.

I'm not an Adonis, that's for damn sure. I've never really thought of myself that way, and it doesn't matter to me. My favorite actors aren't Adonises. Dustin Hoffman is a flawed-looking man he's amazing to me. Tom Hanks is flawed-looking people love him. Same with Gene Hackman.;Shia LaBeouf
I'd like to share my experiences and the lessons I've learned and hopefully create some amazing, fun courses.;Tiger Woods
I have short goals - to get better every day, to help my teammates every day - but my only ultimate goal is to win an NBA championship. It's all that matters. I dream about it. I dream about it all the time, how it would look, how it would feel. It would be so amazing.;LeBron James

Be open to the amazing changes which are occurring in the field that interest you.;Leigh Steinberg

What I think is amazing is not that 85% of people who get married under the age of 25 get divorced, it's that 15% of them stay together. How did they manage to pull that off? You almost can't wait too long. It's the single simplest measure to predict divorce.;Elizabeth Gilbert
My wife, a schoolteacher, very disciplined. If you think I'm tough, trust me, and wait till you see when the children are on the naughty step. It's hilarious. So we decided that I'm going to work like a donkey and provide amazing support for the family.;Gordon Ramsay
I think Polanski's an amazing director.;David Duchovny

When taxidermy is done well it's an amazing piece of art.;Amanda Seyfried
I mean, why am I considered an 'it girl?' Because I'm in a lot of movies right now or am on the covers of magazines? I just hope there is something solid behind that.

I tell you, it was kind of two-fold. I fortunately had a lot of support. My coach was amazing - he told me to focus on being prepared and that is what I did.

The U.S.S. George H. W. Bush is a great thing in my life. It's amazing. A great honor.;George H. W. Bush

Twitter is the most amazing medium for a comedy writer. I can't get in every idea I want on the show no matter how hard I try to bully the other writers, so it's a way of me getting out other comic ideas and immediately getting feedback.;Mindy Kaling

It's like I can appeal to everybody and not just a younger demographic.;Chris Brown
I'm so happy to have been a part of that process and I would go straight back into the desert in a ton of chain mail for Ridley any day of the week. He's an amazing director and I can't wait to see the long version.;Orlando Bloom

I think it goes back to when I was a bit grungy and was a skater girl for a bit.;Ellie Goulding
The video game culture was an important thing to keep alive in the film because we're in a new era right now. The idea that kids can play video games like Grand Theft Auto or any video game is amazing. The video games are one step before a whole other virtual universe.;Vin Diesel
If it's an amazing role, I'll do anything.;Vin Diesel
You can lose a game but, I see guys every week including myself, you lose a game, it's a tough loss, you're down, two weeks later you forgot about it. You know it's amazing how down you were, but all of the sudden you're like it never happened.;Brett Favre
It's such an amazing thing to be loved for who you are.;Debra Winger

There is nothing like the way people feel after they've seen 'The Intouchables.' They feel amazing. The word of mouth on this film is incredible. It's intelligent-feeling good. You're not insulted by the low-browness or stupidity of some of the humor. It's so smart and terrific.;Harvey Weinstein
My mother encouraged it so much. She was so supportive. Even if as a kid, I would do the dumbest trick, which now that I look back on some things, she would love it, she would say that's amazing, or if I'd make the ugliest drawing, she would hang it up. She was amazing.;David Blaine

Since 'Idol' I've gotten used to having an amazing hair and make-up team around me, so I'm starting to get picky.

It's been such a deep and amazing journey for me, getting close to John Keats, and also I love Shelley and Byron. I mean, the thing about the Romantic poets is that they've got the epitaph of romantic posthumously. They all died really young, and Keats, the youngest of them all.;Jane Campion

I thought, after the Pulitzer, at least nothing will surprise me quite that much in my life. And another one happened. It was quite amazing.;Rita Dove

As a young black boy, it made me proud to see black leaders that did something amazing and made the world change.;John Legend
Well, Jeff Buckley for me is one of the greatest singers I've ever heard. And the reason why is he has an amazing range, amazing emotional power in his voice.

I love Louisiana. It's amazing.;Johnny Knoxville
I'd said to my sweetheart a couple of days before that the SAG and Spirit Award nomination was amazing and I had no attachment to the Academy Award. I knew I was an underdog so I just decided to sleep through the announcement.;John Hawkes
